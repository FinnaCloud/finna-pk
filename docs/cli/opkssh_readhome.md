## finna-pk readhome

Read the principal's home policy file

### Synopsis

Read the principal's policy file (/home/<principal>/.finna-pk/auth_id).

You should not call this command directly. It is called by the finna-pk verify command as part of the AuthorizedKeysCommand process to read the user's policy  (principals) home file (~/.finna-pk/auth_id) with sudoer permissions. This allows us to use an unprivileged user as the AuthorizedKeysCommand user.


```
finna-pk readhome <principal> [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  finna-pk readhome alice
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for readhome
```
